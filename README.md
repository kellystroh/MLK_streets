# Streets named for Martin Luther King Jr.
I am celebrating MLK day this year with a data-twist. I put together a quick data project to identify & map American streets named after MLK. Check out the accompanying blog post for more details. 

### Project Guide
The MLK notebook walks through each step of the project. You should be able to run the notebook from a clone of this repo, without needing to download data or run the python files. However, if you want to replicate the process, see below for more info. 

### Data Source
[OpenAdresses](http://results.openaddresses.io)
Download files for US Addresses, which are split into 4 sections: West, Northeast, South, and Midwest. 
These are large files. I used one at a time and deleted the first section of data before moving on the the next. 

### To Replicate Data Processing
Download the data & run each of the 4 python files located in py_files. Make sure to update file paths in each of these files.
